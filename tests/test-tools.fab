# Output the path of the fab binary to a file:
# RUN: echo "fab: %fab" > %t
#
# Run the resultant file through FileCheck:
# RUN: %check %s -input-file %t
#

#
# Let FileCheck ensure that the file contains a path to a fab binary, and that
# the path is absolute (or at least that it's contained in a directory):
#

# CHECK: fab: {{.*}}/fab
